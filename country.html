    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Albania</h4>
    <p>The Albanian Education System is organized in two main levels: Pre-University Education System and Higher Education 
        System.Admissions criteria are set annually by the government and high school students meeting the average score and 
        admissions criteria have the right to continue tertiary education. Education Institutions might also approve 
        additional admission criteria depending on the school. Public tertiary education in Albania charges moderate fees 
        that are approved by the universities, while private education tuition varies depending on the school.Government 
        education spending in Albania is small comprising only 3.96 percent of the GDP in 2016. Less than approximately 
        one-fourth of it is dedicated to tertiary education.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Albania Benefits</h4>
    <p>The Albanian Government Excellence Fund, approved annually, supports Albanian students who get admitted to the top 
        15 Universities ranked by the Time’s Higher Education World University Ranking, both by overall and/or by the 
        subject of the study. Most of the top-15 universities worldwide are U.S. universities, and this might create 
        opportunities for those schools to recruit students from Albania. In addition, the Government of Albania supports 
        with up to 8,000 euros, students admitted by accredited universities in U.S.A. or EU, provided that these 
        universities offer to students, financial aid that amounts to 75 percent of the total education cost. </p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Australia</h4>
    <p>The unique factor of the Australian education system is its implementation of Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF),
         the national policy established in 1995 that specifies the standards of qualifications for the tertiary education 
         sector (higher education, vocational education and training) in addition to the school leaving certificate, called 
         the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education. With AQF, your degree is recognised and authorised by the government.
         Under the AQF, there are 10 levels that interconnects various schools, colleges, universities and educational 
         institutions in one single national system. This allows flexibility, choice and better career planning for students 
         to move from one study level to another as long as their student visa requirements are fulfilled.</p>

            <li>Work-student life balance</li>
            <li>Student Safety</li>
            <li>Immigration Opportunities</li>
            <li>Job Opportunities</li>
         </ul>
    <p>You need never worry about finding people from your own country here! Australia is third behind only the United 
        States and the United Kingdom in terms of numbers of international students, and has seen at least 200,000 foreign 
        students attend its universities for the past several years. With study abroad programs in Australia becoming 
        increasingly popular around the world, Australia is a very accessible destination for international students. 
    </p>
    <p>The major universities here welcome international students, and provide programs and services that are tailored 
        toward helping study abroad students make the most out of their educational experience.There are over 40 universities 
        in Australia, and each of them offers vast and varied opportunities to study a range of different subjects.</p>

    <h4>This is Bahrain Country</h4>
    <p>Bahrain has been an expat hotspot for decades. In fact, the expat population outnumbers the locals. Bahrain is located at the heart of the Persian Gulf and is a commercial and cultural hub of the region. Its population is nearly 1.3 million, and even though it is a small sovereign state, it is the fourth most densely populated destination in the world. Bahraini nationals account for just 48 percent of the population, with the rest being expats from different parts of the world.Expats moving to Bahrain for professional reasons will discover that the salaries are high. There are also no personal taxes, adding to its appeal as an expat destination. Most people living and working in Bahrain maintain that they earn a larger disposable income and have a higher standard of living that they did in their home countries. Expats constitute a major part of the workforce, at almost 70 percent. Here is a closer look at what it is like to live and work in Bahrain.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Canada</h4>
    <p>Education in Canada is a very high priority of the government.  The country boasts a state-run system of public 
        education, one that is provided, funded and administered by federal, provincial and local governments.  
        Jurisdiction of the public education system, as well its curriculum, is overseen by each province.  
        As a result, one can expect to see slight variations in the educational systems of each province (the type of 
        programs offered, minimum and maximum age requirements, etc.), but the similarities in those systems far outweigh 
        the differences.</p>

    <p>Aspiring students in Canada have a plethora of full time job opportunities after graduation. There are a horde of 
        companies offering well paying and attractive job packages that help international students get their life on track. 
        The Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) lets international students stay in Canada and work for up to three years after 
        their studies. Moreover, these international students will be eligible to apply for permanent residency after their 
        one-year employment in Canada. As per government norms, international students also have a chance to take up part

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Croatia</h4>
    <p>All children legally staying in Croatia have the right to enrol in kindergartens, preschool, elementary school and 
        secondary school. This include children asylum seekers, children granted international protection and children with 
        temporary residence who came in Croatia in family reunification.Kindergartens are not mandatory. They are open for 
        enrolment throughout the school year, so you can enrol your child if they have places left. Usually, you will have 
        to apply in May for the next educational year, which lasts from September of the same year until August next year.
        Preschool is mandatory for all children in the year before they start elementary school regularly (at age of 6).</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Croatia Benefits</h4>
    <p>Croatia has a great job market for locals and foreigners alike. Unemployment rates are low, and more than 50.000 
        foreigners find work in Croatia every year. Because of the high demand for workers in different sectors, the 
        government allows international students to work in the country during their stay.One of the best benefits of living 
        in a country with a small population is enjoying the urban environment without overcrowded cities. The academic year 
        in Croatia starts in October and lasts until June, so because it doesn’t coincide with high tourism season, students 
        won’t have to deal with crowded cities most of the year.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Germany</h4>
    <p>The state runs most German schools and they are free to attend. However, parents can also opt for one of the many 
        fee-paying private or international schools. With different types of institutions to choose from at the secondary 
        level, in particular, it’s a good idea to think carefully and weigh up the different options before choosing a 
        school in Germany.The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung – 
        BMBF) is responsible for the overall German education system. However, each Federal state (Länd) has its own 
        Ministry of Education which sets its own education program, schools, and standards.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Hungary</h4>
    <p>Education in Hungary is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 16. The child may have had the benefit of a kindergarten 
        (óvoda) experience prior to school entry but formally begins school (általános iskola) at 6 and remains in that 
        school until 14. At 14 the child will attend a secondary school, either a grammar school devoted primarily to 
        academic studies (gimnázium) or a vocational school (szakközépiskola). While the pupil is permitted to leave school 
        at 16, most continue to 18 years of age. Further study in institutes of higher education is by competitive entry 
        and less than one fifth of all students go on to colleges and universities.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Hungary Benefits</h4>
    <p>Hungary is one of the amazingplace to study, being that the country is a member of the European Union and also a 
        Schengen State. The tuition fee in Hungary are relatively affordable, compared to most other parts of Europe. Also, 
        living costs are relatively low compared to the rest of Europe. Hungary may not be one of the most sought out study 
        abroad destinations for university students, but its cultural richness and international opportunities are highly 
        undervalued. Courses are taken 100% in English medium but students will still have to learn the Hungarian Language 
        for easy communication within the country. Hence, students can easily cope up with other cultures of other countries 
        of the world. You can study in Hungary without IELTS or TOEFL.</p>

    <h4>Living and Working in Kuwait</h4>
    <p>
        It is quite costly for an average western or African expat to live in Kuwait. This country is not a popular destination for expats even though its currency is the highest globally. Kuwait is an Asian country and it upholds the Muslim traditions and culture at all cost. If you’ll be living and working in Kuwait, there is every tendency that you must be a Muslim.
       <br><br> However, adjusting to life in a new environment is sometimes a tough task. But, expats who have lived all their lives traveling from one location to another do not find it difficult to adapt to new environments.
    </p>
    <h4>Living in Kuwait</h4>
    <p>
        The weather/temperature in Kuwait is not actually normal; during summer, the weather is extremely hot (gets up to 130oF). You’ll have to set the air conditioner in your room to the lowest temperature so as to feel a bit cold.
     <br><br>   Also, house rent in Kuwait is a bit pricey; you may pay up to $1000 monthly or more, it all depends on where you choose to live. Even so, most apartments (if not all) have a manager (Haris) who arranges for your trash can/bucket to be taken out when due and your car washed, all for a little token monthly. Living and working in Kuwait won’t be easy during your initial stay in this country.

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Malaysia</h4>
    <p>Malaysia is both a big sender and big receiver of international students, although inward and outward mobility 
        numbers have been heading in opposite directions in recent years. In 1995, for example, 20 percent of all Malaysian 
        students at the higher education level were studying abroad, mainly on government scholarships to the tune of an 
        estimated US$800 million annually. Prior to the Southeast Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, there were more than 
        100,000 Malaysian students abroad, mainly in the UK and the U.S, but funding for scholarships was cut dramatically 
        after the crisis, and in 2010 there were fewer than 80,000 Malaysians studying internationally (World Bank, 2013).</p>

    <h4>Living and Working in Oman</h4>
    <p>Ever wondered what it would be like to live and teach in the Middle East? Life in Oman is full of history and daily adventures. If you’re looking to teach English in Oman, you will be in for the time of your life. If you’ve never visited or lived in a Middle Eastern country, it’s hard to know what to expect, so we’ve outlined a few important topics for you to consider.
    Oman is a very beautiful country, and the great city of Muscat lies in a valley surrounded by mountains and the sea. Oman has some of the region’s finest beaches out of the nearby coastal countries, and Muscat itself has many points of interest for foreigners to visit and explore. The beaches are kept very clean, and the surrounding mountains make for a magnificent view.</p>
    <h4>Population:</h4>
    <p>4.5 million – similar to that of Ireland</p>
    <p>Muscat is the capital with a population of about 1.5 million people. Most teaching opportunities will be here as it’s the central hub of the nation.</p>
    <h4>Things to do in Oman</h4>
    <p>For you sports buffs, there’s a pretty popular sports scene in Oman, and racing is HUGE in Oman. You can watch racing events that range from horse, camel, and dhow (a type of sailing) racing. Also, there’s football (soccer), bullfighting, falconry, waterskiing, and sandboarding. FIFA qualifiers are sometimes held in Oman for you football fans. If you’re an outdoor person, Oman is your paradise. With the sea and the sand at your disposal, the sky is the limit regarding all of the sports activities that you can do. A weekend can mean anything from going to the beach, turtle watching, kite surfing, wakeboarding, shipwreck diving, or off-road riding through the desert. If you’re feeling like seeing some huge historic attractions, you can visit the Grand Opera House or the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque. In addition, the Muttrah Souk is the most famous market within Muscat, so be prepared to shop. In the Muttrah Souk, you’ll see everything from local clothing, food, rugs, incense, and more, and don’t forget to bargain! Most shops will accept credit/debit cards, but having cash is your best bet.</p>
    <p>Oman is an hour flight from Dubai and Abu Dhabi making it easy to experience the Emirati lifestyle as well if you’re interested in traveling a bit during your teaching stay.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Poland</h4>
    <p>Poland has a long and proud tradition of keeping educational institutions available for students even at difficult 
        times.  Have you ever heard about the Polish Flying University? In the late 1800s universities were heavily 
        controlled and women were not allowed admission. Polish scholars began a brave underground movement in which courses 
        were secretly taught.To avoid authorities, these meetings were even held in private homes teaching everything from 
        philosophy or mathematics to arts and science. In order to avoid a possible reveal, the meetings frequently moved 
        from location to location around Warsaw, earning it the name Floating or Flying University.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Portugal</h4>
    <p>The Ministry of Education (Direção-Geral da Educação – DGE) regulates the education system in Portugal, starting from 
        pre-school up until secondary school. School groups (agrupamentos escolares) also work closely with local 
        municipalities to assign funding and define the curriculum. The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Higher 
        Education (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior – MCTES) oversees policies and budgets for tertiary 
        education in the country.While Portugal offers a mix of state and private schools, most Portuguese families send 
        their children to state schools because they are free and local. Many parents also enroll their children before 
        the age of six, which is when mandatory education begins. However, private institutions have other benefits.</p>

    <h4>This is Qatar Country</h4>
    <p>
        Like many other Gulf countries, Qatar is a combination of an ancient past and 21st century technology and architecture. It is a country in transition that has retained its traditionalism, while in the process of modernising.
        <br><br>
        The overriding influence on life in Qatar, past and present, is Islam. The Qataris remain faithful to their roots; Islam and tribal and family ties are very strong. The tenets of Islam are integral to all aspects of daily life, both social and business.
        <br><br>
        Until the discovery of oil in the middle of the 20th century, Qatar had few inhabitants and relied on trading, pearling, and fishing. Many of the prominent Qatari families, including the ruling al-Thani family, are former pearl merchants.
        <br><br>
        The economy of Qatar is subject to centralised state control. The government owns or directly controls the country’s mineral wealth, major manufacturing enterprises, banks, and insurance companies. After years of relying almost entirely on oil, Qatar’s continued prosperity now depends on modernisation and diversification, as well as on the efficient, cost-effective and timely export of natural gas. The government continues to work towards these goals.
        <br><br>
        Politically, Qatar became fully independent from Britain in 1971. Today it is a constitutional monarchy, with the emir as the head of state. This position is passed on within the al-Thani ruling family. The highest executive body in Qatar is the Council of Ministers, which comprises both elected and appointed officials. The Council of Ministers initiates legislation, which is then referred to the Consultative Assembly, or Majilis Al Shura, for further discussion. The Emir then ratifies legislation submitted to him by the Majilis Al Shura. Laws are announced by the emir, as are elections to the legislative assemblies.
        <br><br>
        Sharia Islamic Holy Law, the Sharia, is the fibre of life in Qatar as it is throughout the Arabian peninsula, where it was born and continues to flourish. The call to prayer can be heard from the mosques five times a day, starting at daybreak. In accordance with the tenants of Islam, some public institutions, such as schools, are segregated by sex or offer special days when only women can attend. There are also family sections in restaurants for women only. Social functions, such as weddings and teas, are often segregated with men and women in different rooms. Qatari women can vote in public elections, and may drive cars.
        <br><br>
        Expatriates will find some aspects of the society exotic and colourful. In public, women wear veils to cover their hair and part of their faces, as well as heavy black robes called abayas to cover their bodies. Many of the older, more traditional women wear a face mask called the batula. They also wear large head scarves called hijabs. Qatari men wear long white thobes, floor-length robes. They wear sandals and a three-part head covering called a ghutra.
        <br><br>
        Foreign visitors and residents may find some of the Islamic influences restrictive, particularly for women in a publicly male-dominated society. However, they will also find that Qatari people have the traditional Arab values of hospitality, family honour, and generosity.
        <br><br>
        Most of the population of Qatar lives in and around Doha, the capital. Nearly all Qataris are followers of Islam and speak predominately Arabic dialects; most know at least some English. Foreign workers with temporary residence status, however, make up nearly 50 per cent of the population. They are predominately from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, and Iran. The population is growing at about 5 per cent annually.
        <br><br>
        In the not-so-distant past, Qatar was a small desert country where commerce consisted of trading, pearling, and fishing. Although commercial pearling in Qatar was supplanted by the Japanese cultured pearl industry in the early 1900s, the traditions lived on, and many of today’s prominent Qatari families are descendants of pearlers.
        <br><br>
        Indigenous Qataris, who are of Arab and Bedouin or Persian origin, make up only about half the population. Descendants of migrating tribes, mainly from Najd, al-Hasa, and Oman, they began arriving in Qatar in the 1700s.
        <br><br>
        The government of Qatar encourages foreign investment, particularly in joint ventures with Qatari partners. Qataris welcome foreigners with business expertise and knowledge. The number of international firms in Qatar continues to increase. Westerners in particular are treated with respect and politeness.
        <br><br>
        There is, however, a definite and pronounced bias among Qataris in favour of Qatari firms and ventures with Qatari participation. This bias also prevails within the workplace, where the owner or most senior person in a company will be a Qatari. Managerial positions will be held by Qataris and other Arabs, including many Palestinians, plus expatriate British and other Westerners. Qatar hopes to increase the number of its own citizens in management positions, and is emphasising education, training, and employment in the private sector.
        <br><br>
        Much of Qatar’s population is made up of foreign workers from India, Pakistan, and the Philippines who have immigrated for employment. The recruitment of foreign labour is controlled by the Ministry of Interior, and the Labour Department.

<p>Romanian education continues to throw off the shackles of the past, although the fact that a parallel private 
    tutoring system exists at all suggests that the ministry of education and research still has a way to go with

    age 7, and takes 4 years. For their entire public school life education will be free, although students may be 
    required to pay for supplementary materials and uniforms. The school year runs from september through to june.After

    <h4>Living and Working in saudi Arabia</h4>
    <p>
        Saudi Arabia's oil and gas industry is a major employer and the most likely area for UK graduates to find work. Jobs may also be available in IT, banking and telecommunications. The current focus on diversifying the economy and reducing ownership restrictions on foreign firms may also open up opportunities in healthcare, education, tourism and engineering. Most jobs will be found in Riyadh, the capital city, or Jeddah, the second-largest city.
        <br><br>
        There are opportunities in Saudi Arabia for those with the expertise that it seeks, but it is not easy to get a job there straight after university. You will also find it incredibly difficult to secure a job that could be filled by a citizen of Saudi Arabia due to the country's focus on 'Saudization' in a drive to increase national employment rates.
        <br><br> 
        Your best chance is to get a job with an international company that has offices in Saudi Arabia. It would be easier still to join the company in the UK and transfer to a position in Saudi Arabia once you have gained some specialist skills and knowledge.
        <br><br>
        Arabic is the main business language, so having an understanding of it and the ability to speak it will boost your chances of getting a job offer.
    </p>
    <h4>Where could you work in Saudi Arabia?</h4>
    <p>As expected, the majority of job opportunities are in Saudi Arabia's oil and gas industry. However, as part of its 'Vision 2030', efforts are being made to develop other industries in order to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil.</p>

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in Singapore</h4>
    <p>In Singapore, the system includes six years of primary school, followed by four to six years of secondary school, and 
        one to three years of postsecondary school. The curriculum for primary schools is common for all students in years 
        one to four. For years five and six, students can take individual courses at the foundation or standard level. 
        Foundational level courses are designed to provide more support for students. As they enter secondary school, 
        students, their parents, and their teachers jointly agree on one of three bands or “streams” they will join: Express, 
        Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical).</p>
    <figure><img src="img/thumb/singapore1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
    <p>Singapore’s school system encourages project work and creative thinking. As a result, classes focus on equipping 
        students with particular problem-solving skills and knowledge in specific subjects. The goal of the curriculum is 
        to provide students with practical knowledge and skills that will help to solve challenges in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>Any first-rate school system must have good leadership and be backed by a professionally capable team. The critical 
        components of the Singapore education system are the teachers. The country targets teachers from the top 5% of 
        graduates who must undergo training at the National Institute of Education (NIE).</p>

        awarded to students who have completed 2-3 years of the study program and defended a thesis.

    <h4>Study, Work, Live in UAE Benefits</h4>
    <p>If you are a resident in the UAE, the added benefits that you will get by studying here are plenty. You can save up 
        on extra costs such as accommodation and travel. Also, you will not experience the homesickness that comes with going 
        away for university. I’ve found it much easier to cope with the transition to university since I did not have to 
        also juggle the pressure of living alone in a new country.And there you have it.</p>
    <p>The six points above shaped my 
        experience attending university in the UAE. As you can see, there are multiple benefits for students to study in 
        Dubai, Abu Dhabi or the other emirates. That includes studying in a cosmopolitan country to enjoying the fabulous 
        opportunities provided to higher education students here.</p>
    <p>
        The UAE is a place where tradition meets modernity. Made up of seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Sharjah, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain - the UAE's relentless growth over recent years has made working there look impressive on any CV.
<br><br>
English is the main language of business and around 85% of the population comes from abroad so you'll have no trouble fitting in.
<br><br>
Opportunities exist all over this diverse country, but most jobs in the UAE are found in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The cost of living is fairly expensive but you get your money's worth as the standard of living is world class.
<br><br>
Living and working in the Gulf region you'll be able to explore Islamic culture but to avoid getting in trouble with the law you'll need to respect local laws and customs. There can be severe penalties for breaking these. For example, there is a zero tolerance policy towards drugs and drink driving. Relationships outside of marriage are illegal as is same sex marriage. You'll need a special licence to consume alcohol and women should dress modestly when out in public. Also be aware that swearing in public and public displays of affection are arrestable offences.
<br><br>
On your days off you'll be able to enjoy hot weather in summer and warm days in winter. You can visit idyllic sandy beaches and cosmopolitan landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest building in the world and the Dubai Mall.
<br><br>
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic be sure to check the latest foreign travel advice for UAE at GOV.UK.
